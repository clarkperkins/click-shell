Installation
============

The easiest way to install is with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install click-shell

.. warning::

    Versions of click-shell 3.0.0 and higher no longer support python 2 and click 6.
    If you require python 2 or click 6, please remain on click-shell 2.x.


If you'd rather, you can clone the github repo and install manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/clarkperkins/click-shell.git
    python setup.py install
