click-shell
===========

|TravisCI| |DocsStatus|

click-shell is an extension to `click`_ that easily turns your click app into a shell utility.
It is built on top of the built in python `cmd`_ module, with modifications to make it work with click.


Features
--------

* Adds a "shell" mode **with command completion** to any click app
* Just a one line change for most click apps


Usage
-----

Simply replace ``@click.group`` with ``@click_shell.shell`` on the root level command:


.. code-block:: python

    from click_shell import shell

    # @click.group()  # no longer
    @shell(prompt='my-app > ', intro='Starting my app...')
    def my_app():
        pass

    @my_app.command('the_command')
    def the_command():
        print 'the_command is running'

    ...


When run, you should expect an output like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python my_app.py
    Starting my app...
    my-app > the_command
    the_command is running


.. note::

    It should be noted that this decorator **only** alters functionality if no arguments are
    passed on the command line.  If you try to run a command directly
    (like ``python my_app.py the_command`` in the above example), your app will function
    identically to how it did before.
